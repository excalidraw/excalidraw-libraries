They\nplay a crucial role in controlling the viscosity, drying rate, and application\nproperties of coatings, ensuring uniform film formation and optimal\nperformance. The selection of appropriate solvents is critical for achieving\ndesired coating characteristics and meeting specific application\nrequirements.\n\nThe primary function of coating solvents is to reduce the viscosity of the\ncoating formulation, making it easier to apply. This viscosity reduction\nallows for smooth and even application using various techniques, such as\nspraying, brushing, or rolling.
