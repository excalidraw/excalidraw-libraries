## Create your own library

1. Open [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and draw some objects.
2. Optional: Make sure every object is it's own group (by selecting it and clicking "Group selection" or `Ctrl`+`G`).
3. Add each object you want in your library like so:

- Select the object
- Open the library menu (by clicking on the "library" button or typing `9`)
- The selected object should appear in a square. Click on it (you will see a `+` sign when hovering over it)

4. Still in the library menu, select the libraries you want to publish (hover over a library item and you should see a checkbox, clicking on which will select the library item).

5. Hit the publish button (in blue), and fill out the details.

If you want to test your library file, use the "Load" button in the library menu to reimport it.

## Guidelines

- All library items should be reusable and not just limited to your personal use case.
- Don't republish (copy/paste) items from other libraries without making any significant changes.
- In general, each item should be usable and stand on its own.
- Don't publish items which are easy to create directly. For example, a single arrow or a square.
