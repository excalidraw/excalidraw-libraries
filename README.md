## Create your own library

1. Open [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and draw some objects.
2. Optional: Make sure every object is it's own group (by selecting it and clicking "Group selection" or `Ctrl`+`G`).
3. Add each object you want in your library like so:

- Select the object
- Open the library menu (by clicking on the "library" button or typing `9`)
- The selected object should appear in a square. Click on it (you will see a `+` sign when hovering over it)

4. Still in the library menu, click on "Export". You will get a `.excalidrawlib` file with all your added objects in it.

If you want to test your library file, use the "Load" button in the library menu to reimport it.
