## Create your own library

1. Open [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and draw some objects.
2. Optional: Make sure every object is it's own group (by selecting it and clicking "Group selection" or `Ctrl`+`G`).
3. Add each object you want in your library like so:

- Select the object
- Open the library menu (by clicking on the "library" button or typing `9`)
- The selected object should appear in a square. Click on it (you will see a `+` sign when hovering over it)

4. Still in the library menu, select the libraries you want to publish (Hover over the library items and you should see a checkbox, clicking on which will select the library item).

5. Hit the publish button.

If you want to test your library file, use the "Load" button in the library menu to reimport it.

## Guidelines

-  All library items should be generic and reusable.
- Don't republish (copy/paste) items from other libraries without making any significant changes.
- Each item should stand on its own and add value.
Eg Adding single square or a squiggly line doesn't meet standard.
